### The Merge Sort Algorithm
The Merge Sort algorithm combines the split and merge step, to give us a sorted array.

   - First, we keep splitting the array recursively, till we get all subarrays of size 1. Recall how we practiced this in the Split step
   - Then, once the array cannot be split further, we start tracing back on our Merge Sort tree
   - As we trace back, we keep merging the child subarrays and overwriting the parent subarrays by their sorted forms.

To get a better overview of how Merge Sort works, look at the video below and then play around with the demo artefact to gain more clarity!
