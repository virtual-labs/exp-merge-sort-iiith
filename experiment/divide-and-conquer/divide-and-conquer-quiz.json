                "b": "This strategy involves dividing the problem into independent subproblems followed by solving or ‘conquering’ each of those subproblems separately and finally combining the solutions into a final solution to the overall problem."

                "c": "The main advantage that this strategy provides is in the fact that the subproblems formulated during division can be solved independently from each other thus making the problem easier to tackle."
