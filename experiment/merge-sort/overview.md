### Prerequisites  

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
   - [Concept of Binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
   - [Basics of Logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore..!

### Overview of the Experiment  
  -  The aim of this experiment is to understand the Merge Sort algorithm, its time and space complexity, and how it compares against other sorting algorithms.
  - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes to self analyze.
