When dividing an array into equal-sized partitions (as closely as possible), how does the number of partitioning rounds/iterations required vary with the number of partitions made per step (fixed number per step)? Note that the number of partitions directly affects the size of the partitions. Greater the number of partitions, the smaller each partition will be.",

                "c": "When you increase the number of partitions made per step, each partitioning round reduces the size of the partitions more significantly. As a result, fewer partitioning rounds/iterations are required to reach the base case where each partition contains a single element or a small number of elements.",
                "d": "The correlation is not direct. Increasing the number of partitions made per steps leads to a decrease in the number of partitioning rounds/iterations."
