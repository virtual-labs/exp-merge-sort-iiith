      "explanations": {
        "a": "<b>Correct.</b> During the merge process an array with length equal to the sum of the lengths of the parts to be merged needs to be allocated to temporarily store the results. Since the size of this array is equal to the number of elements in the array parts to be merged, the space complexity will be O(N).",
        "b": "<b>Incorrect.</b> While merging two arrays, we require an auxiliary space to temporarily store the merged array, before we plug this partially sorted array into the main array. However, the space is used much less than 2^N.",
        "c": "<b>Incorrect.</b> Merge sort is not an inplace sorting algorithm, i.e, the sorting is not done on the original array itself. While merging two arrays, we require an auxiliary space to temporarily store the merged array, before we plug this partially sorted array into the main array.",
        "d": "<b>Incorrect.</b> While merging two arrays, we require an auxiliary space to temporarily store the merged array, before we plug this partially sorted array into the main array. However, the space is used much less than N^2 as the same auxiliary space can be used for each of the subarrays instead of separate spaces."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "<b>Incorrect.</b> This is not possible as during the first division itself [-2, 4] and [1, 100] are separated into different subarrays of size 4 each. Merging must follow the reverse order of division and hence the two subarrays will only be together in the final merged array.",
        "b": "<b>Correct.</b> [7, 8] and [-2, 4] are merged during the merge sort process as part of the correct merging sequence.",
        "c": "<b>Incorrect.</b> This answer is wrong as the subarrays will be sorted during the merging of the individual elements into the arrays of size 2.",
        "d": "<b>Incorrect.</b> This is not possible as during the first division itself 4 is separated from 1 into different subarrays of size 4 each. Merging must follow the reverse order of division and hence the two subarrays will only be together in the final merged array."

        "d": "<b>Incorrect.</b> Here the arrays are divided incorrectly. The first 3 element array is divided into arrays of sizes 1 and 2 in that order while the second 3 element array is divided into arrays of sizes 2 and 1 in that order. Either the second array should have been divided the same as the first, i.e, as arrays of sizes 1 and 2, or vice versa. The same applies for the order of merging, but then merging simply follows the order of division in reverse."
