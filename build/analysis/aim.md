### Learning Objectives of this Module


In this module, we will be learning about:

- **Time and Space Complexity** : We will learn about the running time of the split step, merge step and number of split and merge steps required to complete the sorting process.

- **Stable Sort and Comparison Sort** : We will learn about what stable and comparison sorts are. Then we will see how merge sort is a stable comparison sort.

- **Applications** : We will compare merge sort with other sorting algorithms and see in which situations Merge Sort is the optimal approach to take.
